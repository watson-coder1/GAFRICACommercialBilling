# Payment Sync Solution - Dashboard Zero Payment Issue Fix

## Problem Identified

The dashboard was showing zero payments despite successful M-Pesa transactions because:

1. **M-Pesa payments** are stored in `tbl_mpesa_transactions` and `tbl_portal_sessions`
2. **Dashboard widgets** query only `tbl_transactions` table
3. **No synchronization** existed between M-Pesa payments and main transactions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. PaymentSync Class (`system/autoload/PaymentSync.php`)
- **Purpose**: Synchronizes M-Pesa payments to main transactions table
- **Key Features**:
  - Syncs completed M-Pesa payments to `tbl_transactions`
  - Adds sync tracking columns to prevent duplicates
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging
  - Automatic package name resolution

### 2. Automatic Sync Integration
- **Location**: `system/autoload/MpesaIntegration.php`
- **Enhancement**: Added automatic sync call after successful payment
- **Benefit**: New payments are immediately visible on dashboard

### 3. Manual Sync Script (`sync_payments.php`)
- **Purpose**: Sync existing M-Pesa payments (run once)
- **Usage**: `php sync_payments.php`
- **Output**: Detailed sync report with statistics

### 4. Cron Job Script (`cron_sync_payments.php`)
- **Purpose**: Periodic sync for missed payments
- **Usage**: Add to cron jobs: `*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron_sync_payments.php`
- **Benefit**: Ensures no payments are missed

## Database Changes

### New Columns Added to `tbl_mpesa_transactions`:
- `synced_to_transactions` (TINYINT) - Tracks sync status
- `transaction_ref` (INT) - References main transaction ID

### Synchronized Data in `tbl_transactions`:
- `invoice`: 'MPESA-{mpesa_id}'
- `username`: Phone number
- `plan_name`: Package name
- `price`: Payment amount
- `method`: 'M-Pesa STK Push'
- `recharged_on`: Payment date
- `type`: 'Credit'

## How It Works

### For New Payments:
1. User makes M-Pesa payment
2. Payment callback processed
3. MikroTik user created & auto-login
4. **Payment automatically synced to main transactions**
5. Dashboard immediately shows payment

### For Existing Payments:
1. Run `php sync_payments.php` once
2. All completed M-Pesa payments synced
3. Dashboard shows historical payments
4. Cron job prevents future missed syncs

## Verification Steps

1. **Check M-Pesa Payments**: Look at `tbl_mpesa_transactions` for completed payments
2. **Verify Sync**: Check `synced_to_transactions` column is set to 1
3. **Check Dashboard**: Income widgets should show M-Pesa payment totals
4. **View Logs**: Check `system/uploads/payment_sync.log` for sync details

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `system/autoload/MpesaIntegration.php` - Added automatic sync

### Created:
- `system/autoload/PaymentSync.php` - Core sync functionality
- `sync_payments.php` - Manual sync script
- `cron_sync_payments.php` - Automated sync job
- `check_payments.php` - Payment analysis utility

## Installation Instructions

1. **Upload all files** to your server
2. **Run initial sync**: `php sync_payments.php`
3. **Set up cron job** (optional): `*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/cron_sync_payments.php`
4. **Verify dashboard** shows payments

## Support

- **Logs**: Check `system/uploads/payment_sync.log`
- **Testing**: Use `check_payments.php` to analyze payment data
- **Debugging**: Enable detailed logging in PaymentSync class

## Notes

- Sync process is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Only completed M-Pesa payments are synced
- Original M-Pesa data remains unchanged
- Dashboard widgets unchanged (backward compatible)
- Works with existing hotspot auto-login system

This solution ensures M-Pesa payments are properly reflected in the admin dashboard while maintaining all existing functionality.
