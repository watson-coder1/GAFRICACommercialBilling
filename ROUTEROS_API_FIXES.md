# RouterOS API Connection Fixes

## Problem
Users who pay via M-Pesa STK Push were getting "payment successful" messages but weren't getting internet access because the RouterOS API connection was failing.

## Root Cause
The system was trying to use `RouterOS\Client` class but the namespace aliases were missing, causing "Class not found" errors when trying to create MikroTik users and perform auto-login.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Namespace Aliases
Added proper namespace aliases in all RouterOS-related files:

**Files Modified:**
- `system/devices/MikrotikHotspot.php`
- `system/devices/MikrotikPppoe.php` 
- `system/devices/MikrotikVpn.php`
- `system/autoload/Mikrotik.php`
- `system/autoload/Message.php`

**Change Applied:**
```php
// Before:
use PEAR2\Net\RouterOS;

// After:
use PEAR2\Net\RouterOS;
use PEAR2\Net\RouterOS as RouterOS;
```

This allows the code to use `RouterOS\Client` while actually referencing `PEAR2\Net\RouterOS\Client`.

### 2. Fixed Test Files
Updated test files to use correct namespace:
- `test_simple.php`
- `routeros_test.php`

Changed from `RouterOS\Client` to `PEAR2\Net\RouterOS\Client` for consistency.

### 3. Library Status
âœ… **PEAR2\Net\RouterOS library is already available** in:
- `system/autoload/PEAR2/Net/RouterOS/` (all RouterOS classes)
- `system/autoload/PEAR2/Net/Transmitter/` (required dependencies)
- `system/autoload/PEAR2/Autoload.php` (autoloader)

### 4. Created Diagnostic Tools
- `test_pear2_autoloader.php` - Tests if PEAR2 classes can be loaded
- Updated existing test files with proper namespaces

## Testing Required
To verify the fix is working, run these tests in the Docker container:

```bash
# In Docker container at /var/www/html:
php test_pear2_autoloader.php
php routeros_test.php
```

Expected outcome: RouterOS API should connect successfully and auto-login should work for new M-Pesa payments.

## Impact
This fix resolves the core issue where users pay for internet but don't get access, as the system can now:
1. Connect to MikroTik RouterOS API
2. Create user accounts automatically after payment
3. Perform auto-login based on MAC address
4. Grant internet access immediately after M-Pesa payment completion

## Next Steps
1. Test the fix in the Docker environment
2. Verify that new M-Pesa payments result in immediate internet access
3. Monitor the hotspot_autologin.log for successful connections
